# CarConfigREACTjs

This app is a work in progress, created using ReactJS and ParcelJS as the package bundler. 

To run it, download all the files, open in an IDE such as VS Code, open the terminal and enter the command: parcel index.html

This will download and install all dependencies.

The vehicle information is data driven from hardcoded JSON.
